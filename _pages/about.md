Drug discovery is burdened by high costs ($2.3Bn per drug), lengthy processes (10-15 years), and a 96% failure rate and urgently needs a radical transformation. 

With thousands of diseases lacking cures and illnesses like malaria still devastating millions, the field must evolve into a more efficient engineering process so it can be automated and scaled.

Research aims
======
My research aims to pioneer this change through advanced experimental and computational automations, utilising the growing accessibility of AI, computational physics, and robotics.

I focus on three key areas: 
1. Creating novel ML-grade datasets.
2. Developing new fit-for-purpose predictive modelling capabilities.
3. Redesigning the process by which we design drugs.
